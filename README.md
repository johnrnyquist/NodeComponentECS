# NodeComponentECS

This project started from the Playground [here](https://simonfairbairn.com/generic-node-component-spritekit/). 

One of the big changes I made was converting the extensions on the components into systems.

The project shows how to use Appleâ€™s GameplayKit to create an Entity Component System (ECS).

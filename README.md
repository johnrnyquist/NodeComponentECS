# NodeComponentECS

The project shows how to use Appleâ€™s GameplayKit to create an Entity Component System (ECS). 

This project started from the Playground [here](https://simonfairbairn.com/generic-node-component-spritekit/). 

Changes include converting the extensions on the components into systems (using `GKComponentSystem`), turning it into an Xcode project, and organizing into separate groups and files.
